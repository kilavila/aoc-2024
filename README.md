# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions to the 2024 Advent of Code puzzles, implemented in Lua.
Each dayâ€™s challenge is placed in its own dedicated sub-folder, making it easy to navigate through the various problems.

I'd recommend trying to solve each puzzle before taking a looking at how I solved it.
